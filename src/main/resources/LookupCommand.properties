# GENERAL PROPERTIES FILE GUIDELINES
#	1.	separate lines must have "\" at the end to enable multi-line properties 
#	2.	\, tab, form feed, newline, and carriage return are written as \\, \t, \f \n, and \r, respectively 
#	3.	All lines will be wrapped automatically.  Start a line with <NOWRAP> to disable this. 

# DESCRIPTION:	short description of the command
# REQUIRED:		yes
# NOTES:
short.description=Searches for a given key in a catalog

# DESCRIPTION:	full description of the command
# REQUIRED:		yes
# NOTES:
long.description=The bior_lookup command takes a value from a specific column from data piped in on STDIN, \
finds the line within the target catalog containing that value (matching a JSON key in the catalog), \
and appends the matching JSON data from the catalog as an additional row, \
which is then piped again to STDOUT.\n\
\n\

# DESCRIPTION:	Definition of an example.  There can be zero or more.
# REQUIRED:		no
# NOTES:		property name must start with "example." prefix
example.rsId=\
Given a file with rsIDs:\n \
e.g. \n \
cat rsid.txt \n \
rs1060915 \n \
rs147856441 \n \
rs147856441 \n \
rs149071245 \n \
rs149071245 \n\n \
To find these rsIDs in a dbSNP catalog ($BIOR_CATALOG/dbSNP/137/00-All_GRCh37.tsv.bgz) \
use the lookup command as follows: \n \
cat rsid.txt | bior_lookup  -p ID  -d $BIOR_CATALOG/dbSNP/137/00-All_GRCh37.tsv.bgz  \
 | bior_pretty_print \n \
The resulting rows will look something like: \n\n \
\t1\t  ID\t           rs1060915 \n\
\t2\t  LookupPipe\t   { \n\
\t\t                  "CHROM": "17", \n\
\t\t                  ... \n\
\t\t                  "_id": "rs1060915", \n\
\t\t                  "_type": "variant", \n\
\t\t                  "_landmark": "17", \n\
\t\t                  "_refAllele": "A", \n\
\t\t                  "_altAlleles": [ \n\
\t\t                    "G" \n\
\t\t                  ], \n\
\t\t                  "_minBP": 41234470, \n\
\t\t                  "_maxBP": 41234470 \n\
\t\t                } \n\
This can then be used as the input to bior_overlap and other commands to get additional annotation. \n\

#               the order of how these properties are defined mirrors the order on the command line
