# GENERAL PROPERTIES FILE GUIDELINES
#	1.	separate lines must have "\" at the end to enable multi-line properties 
#	2.	\, tab, form feed, newline, and carriage return are written as \\, \t, \f \n, and \r, respectively 
#	3.	All lines will be wrapped automatically.  Start a line with <NOWRAP> to disable this. 

command.class=edu.mayo.bior.cli.cmd.VCF2VariantCommand

command.name=bior_vcf_to_tjson

short.description=converts VCF data into JSON as an additional column

long.description=\
Takes variant data in VCF 4.0+ format from STDIN and converts it into JSON as an additional column that is output to STDOUT.  \
The added JSON column can then be utilized by other BioR system commands.\n\
\n\
Although the VCF header is not strictly required, it is highly recommended for the following reasons:\n\
\t1. JSON structure has correct datatypes for INFO fields\n\
\t2. JSON structure correctly builds JSON arrays for multi-value INFO fields\n\
\t3. Column names are represented in the data for readability\n\

example.1=\
This is an example of converting some VCF data into an additional JSON column.  \
The VCF data is a single SNP from 1000 genomes that has been trimmed for brevity and saved to a file named example.vcf.  \
The bior_vcf_to_tjson command will parse the VCF data piped into it and add an extra JSON column onto the right that is then output to STDOUT.\n\
