command.class=edu.mayo.bior.cli.cmd.PrettyPrintCommand

command.name=bior_pretty_print

short.description=prints out a single data row in a readable format

long.description=\
This command reads tabular data from STDIN and prints out the selected data row to STDOUT in a human readable format.  \
Columns that are a JSON structure are natively stored as a "one-liner" to preserve the integrity of the original tabular data.  \
As a result, the JSON is extremely difficult to actually read and make sense of it.  \
This command will take the JSON "one-liner" and unroll it into a human readable format.  \

example.1=\
This is a basic example of pretty printing a JSON structure.  \
Some example tabular data with 2 columns is saved to a file named example.tsv.  \
The bior_pretty_print command prints out the columns for row 1 to STDOUT.  Notice how the JSON column is reformatted.\n\
