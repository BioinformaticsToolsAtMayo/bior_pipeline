### This is a list of BioR core attributes that occur in all catalogs (or most anyway), 
### or are common column headers for VCF files that will not appear in catalogs, but could be drilled,
### and therefore should have some description to them
##-----------------------------------------------------
##ColumnName=The key or column name
##Type=The type of the object, as can be determined from parsing the VCF file or taking and educated guess based on the catalog values (Possible values: JSON, String, Integer, Float, Boolean) 
##Count=The number of values that repeatedly occur  (Possible values: 0 (Boolean), 1 (JSON,Integer,Float,String), or '.' (JsonArrays - which will be resolved to other primitives such as String,Integer,Float)
##Description=The description of the ColumnName
##-----------------------------------------------------
#ColumnName	Type	Count	Description
_landmark	String	1	Provides a context for the genomic coordinates _minBP and _maxBP.  Most often this is the chromosome where the feature appears, but could be a known genetic marker, gene, or other item. (BioR field)
_id	String	1	An identifier (preferably unique) from the catalog  (BioR field)
_type	String	1	The object type (variant, gene, drug, pathway, etc) (BioR field)
_refAllele	String	1	The reference allele (BioR field)
_altAlleles	String	.	One or more alternate alleles (non-reference) in a JSON array (basically a comma-separated list) (BioR field)
_minBP	Integer	1	The minimum (starting) 1-based base pair position within the chromosome (BioR field)
_maxBP	Integer	1	The maximum (ending) 1-based base pair position within the chromosome (BioR field)
_strand	String	1	The strand direction that this variant occurs on ("+" for forward, or "-" for reverse) (BioR field)

#ColumnName	Type	Count	Description
CHROM	String	1	Chromosome. (VCF field)
POS	Integer	1	The reference position, with the 1st base having position 1. (VCF field)
ID	String	.	Semi-colon separated list of unique identifiers.  If this is a dbSNP variant, the rs number(s) should be used.  (VCF field) 
REF	String	1	Reference base(s), which must be one of A,C,G,T,N (case-insensitive).  Multiple bases permitted. (VCF field)
ALT	String	.	Comma-separated list of alternate non-reference alleles called on at least one of the samples, made up of strings of bases A,C,G,T,N (case-insensitive). (VCF field)
QUAL	Float	1	Phred-scaled quality score for the assertion made in ALT, with high QUAL scores indicating high confidence calls. (VCF field)
FILTER	String	.	PASS if this position has passed all filters (i.e. a call is made at this position).  Otherwise if the site has not passed all filters, a semicolon-separated list of codes for filters that failed. (VCF field)
INFO	JSON	1	A JSON object constructed from the INFO field of a VCF file (BioR field)
