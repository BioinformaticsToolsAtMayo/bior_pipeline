1) For variants, check if 1-based (not 0-based)
2) For column and dataSource properties, prompt user for different fields, giving specific examples of each
    - Could be either a command or UI, but the properties files should be generated automatically.
3) Guarantee that the ShortUniqueName is NOT taken by another catalog in either the BioR or user catalogs
4) Verify some fields with RefData  (?? Is this referring to the build, version, name, etc)
5) BioR fields such as _landmark, _minBP, etc should be automatically added from a different properties file with the code
    - Don't make users duplicate this since we control those fields
    - Each of these keys should have a description just like the other catalogs keys
6) Verify each new catalog has the required BioR fields, especially if the user wants to use bior_same_variant, or bior_annotate on them
