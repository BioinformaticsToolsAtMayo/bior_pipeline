# Column properties file for Catalog - genes. Please fill in the description to the below keys.
_type=The object type (variant, gene, drug, pathway, etc) (BioR field)
_landmark=Provides a context for the genomic coordinates _minBP and _maxBP.  Most often this is the chromosome where the feature appears, but could be a known genetic marker, gene, or other item. (BioR field)
_strand=The strand direction that this variant occurs on ("+" for forward, or "-" for reverse) (BioR field)
_minBP=The minimum (starting) 1-based base pair position within the chromosome (BioR field)
_maxBP=The maximum (ending) 1-based base pair position within the chromosome (BioR field)
