#  CatalogShortUniqueName will appear in vcf output files and may be duplicated many times per line - so keep as short as possible
# It should also not conflict with any other catalog (in either BioR or user space)
# The CatalogShortUniqueName should only have alpha-numeric characters or '_' (A-Z, 0-9, '_').  
# No dots allowed as they will be used as separators with any column names.
