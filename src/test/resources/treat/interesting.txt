notes on bringing together a full demo of bior as treat

The catalogs in this directory where constructed using the following region in the genome: 17:41196312-41297272

You can extract parts of the catalogs with commands like:
tabix /data/catalogs/1000_genomes/20110521/ALL.wgs.phase1_release_v3.20101123.snps_indels_sv.sites_GRCh37.tsv.gz 17:41196312-41297272 > brca1.1000_genomes.tsv

This was done for the following catalogs:
1) dbsnp
2) thousandGenomes
3) ESP
4) Cosmic
5) Hapmap
6) NCBIGene

using the BRCA1 gene:


You can cat the contents of one of these slices to see the size of a catalog:
bior@biordev:~/bior_lite/bior_pipeline/src/test/resources/treat$ zcat brca1.dbsnp.tsv.gz | wc -l
3106

Sizes of the above catalogs are as follows:

I wanted to make a 'GOD' VCF file that had all the SNPs in each of the VCF files.

bior@biordev:~/bior_lite/bior_pipeline/src/test/resources/treat$ sort treat.vcf | uniq | wc -l
3130
