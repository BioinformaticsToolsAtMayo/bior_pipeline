NAME
	bior_index -- Creates an index from a given catalog

SYNOPSIS
	bior_index --pathJson <JSON path> [--log] [--help] [--index <Index file to create>] CATALOG_BGZIP_FILE

DESCRIPTION
	Creates a searchable index for a key contained within the JSON column of a given catalog.  The
	output is an H2 database with a table called 'Indexer' that contains a Key/FilePosition pair,
	where the FilePosition is a location within the catalog bgzip file pointing to the beginning
	of the line containing the key. By default, the index file is stored within the catalog's
	./index/ subdirectory in the format: ./index/[catalogPrefix].[JsonPath].idx.h2.db Users can
	also create their own indexes by using the --index flag and specifying a location to write the
	index file.

	The arguments are as follows:

	CATALOG_BGZIP_FILE
		The catalog file (bgzip format) that will be indexed.

	The options are as follows:

	-p, --pathJson <JSON path>
		A JSON path that will be used to find and extract data from the catalog matching this key
		within the catalog's JSON column.  Paths are case sensitive.

	-l, --log
		Use this option to generate the log file. By default, log file is not generated.

	-h, --help
		print this message

	-x, --index <Index file to create>
		The path to the index file that will be built.  This should have a similar format to the
		catalog.  For example: [catalogPrefix].[JsonPath].idx.h2.db. If not specified, the index file
		will be created within the index subfolder where the catalog is located.

EXAMPLE
	This is a basic example of creating an index based on a key contained within the catalog's
	JSON structure.  Here, the bior_index command creates an index on the HGNC id within the
	catalog's JSON column.
	
	bior_index  /data4/bsi/refdata-new/catalogs/v1/NCBIGene/GRCh37_p10/genes.tsv.bgz  -p HGNC 
	OR
	bior_index  /data4/bsi/refdata-new/catalogs/v1/NCBIGene/GRCh37_p10/genes.tsv.bgz  -p HGNC  -x
	/data/myindexes/genes.HGNC.idx.h2.db
