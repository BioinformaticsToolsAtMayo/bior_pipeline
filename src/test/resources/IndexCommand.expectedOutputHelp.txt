NAME
	bior_index -- Creates an index from a given catalog

SYNOPSIS
	bior_index [--column <arg>] [--pathJson <JSON path>] [--log] [--help] [--isKeyAnInt <Is Key an integer>] CATALOG_BGZIP_FILE INDEX_FILE_OUT

DESCRIPTION
	Creates a key/filePosition index in an H2 database for a given catalog.  The catalog is a
	bgzip file that contains a JSON string.  The index key can be based on either a column, or a
	column/JsonPath pair.  The output is an H2 database with a table called 'Indexer' that
	contains a Key/FilePosition pair, where the FilePosition is a location within the catalog
	bgzip file.

	The arguments are as follows:

	CATALOG_BGZIP_FILE
		The catalog file (bgzip format) that will be indexed.

	INDEX_FILE_OUT
		The index file that will be created as key-filePosition pairs from keys found within the
		catalog file.  If the key is not found on a row in the catalog, it will not be indexed.

	The options are as follows:

	-c, --column <arg>
		The column containg the key.  Default is -1 which will use the last column.

	-p, --pathJson <JSON path>
		A JSON path that will be used to find and extract data from JSON.  Paths are case sensitive.

	-l, --log
		Use this option to generate the log file. By default, log file is not generated.

	-h, --help
		print this message

	-i, --isKeyAnInt <Is Key an integer>
		If key is an integer, then it will be treated as such to enhance lookups and indexes in the
		index database.

EXAMPLE
	This is a basic example of creating an index based on a key contained within the catalog's
	JSON structure.  Here, the bior_index command creates an index on the HGNC id within the
	catalog's JSON column.
